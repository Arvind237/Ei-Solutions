Project Overview: Rocket Launch Simulator

The Rocket Launch Simulator is a terminal-based application that simulates the launch of a rocket, providing real-time updates on fuel, altitude, speed, and stage progression until the satellite is placed into orbit.

Use Cases

1. Educational Tool: Helps students and enthusiasts learn about rocket science and space missions interactively.
2. Training Simulator: Assists aspiring aerospace engineers and mission controllers in practicing launch procedures.
3. Entertainment: Engages users interested in space and rockets by simulating a launch experience.
4. Testing and Debugging: Provides a controlled environment for developers to test software and hardware components used in rockets.

Features

1. Pre-Launch Checks: Ensures all systems are ready for launch.
   - Command: `start_checks`
   - Output: "All systems are 'Go' for launch."

2. Launch Sequence: Starts the rocket launch and provides real-time updates.
   - Command: `launch`
   - Output: Updates on stage, fuel, altitude, and speed every second.

3. Fast Forward Simulation: Advances the simulation by a specified number of seconds.
   - Command: `fast_forward X`
   - Output: Updated parameters after X seconds.

4. Stage Separation: Automatically handles stage transitions.
   - Output: Messages indicating stage completion and separation.

5. Mission Outcomes: Determines the success or failure of the mission.
   - Output: "Orbit achieved! Mission Successful." or "Mission Failed due to insufficient fuel."

Future Advancements

1. Graphical User Interface (GUI): For a more engaging and intuitive user experience.
2. Enhanced Physics Simulation: More detailed and realistic physics calculations.
3. Multiple Rocket Configurations: Different types of rockets with varying capabilities.
4. Real-Time Data Visualization: Visualize fuel consumption, altitude, and speed over time.
5. Mission Planning and Customization: Plan and customize missions with specific payloads and target orbits.
